## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
3 favorite apps:
Apollo for reddit: Lots of customization
Threads: A really cool UI and feel
DarkSky: Awesome looking weather app and really polished

I would like to build an app similar to what Apollo and DarkSky did, provide users with the best and more snappy experience. Really polished. A Lemmy client or a Weather app would be the apps I would be interested in developing.
## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Unfamiliar with Swift but it was an interesting experience getting to work with it for this prework.
